Design the layout and user interface of the website. This would involve creating wireframes and mockups of the different pages and features, such as the home page, the donation form, and the payment gateway integration.

Develop the website using a web development framework such as React or Angular. This would involve writing the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to create the website's user interface and functionality.

Implement the donation form. This would involve creating the form fields and validating the user's input to ensure that all required information is provided and is accurate.

Integrate the website with a payment gateway. This would allow the website to process donations securely and transfer the funds to the organization's bank account.

Set up a database to store the donation data. This would involve creating a database schema to define the structure of the data, and implementing the logic to store and retrieve the data from the database.

Test the website to ensure that it is functioning correctly and that all features are working as expected. This would involve manually testing the different pages and features, as well as implementing automated tests to validate the website's functionality.

Deploy the website to a web server or hosting provider. This would involve configuring the web server and deploying the website's code and assets to the server.
